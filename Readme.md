## 💡 Motivation

This project was built to gain hands-on experience with backend development using the **Node.js ecosystem**.\
 Key motivations include:

- 🔧 Understanding how REST APIs are structured and secured
- 🔐 Learning how user authentication works with JWT and middleware
- 🗃️ Exploring how to model and query data efficiently using Mongoose
- 🧱 Creating a scalable project architecture with clean separation of concerns
- 🚀 Preparing for real-world backend tasks in internships or production apps

This serves as a strong foundation for any MERN stack or API-driven project.
